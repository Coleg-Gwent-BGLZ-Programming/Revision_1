# Python Data Structures and Best Practices for Level 3 Learners

This repository contains Python programs and activities designed for **A-Level Computer Science** and **Level 3 BTEC Computing** learners. It covers:

- ✅ Arrays (Lists in Python)
- ✅ Stacks (LIFO)
- ✅ Queues (FIFO)
- ✅ Naming Conventions
- ✅ Multi-Dimensional Arrays (Lists and `array` module)

---

## 📚 Learning Objectives
By the end of this repository, learners will:
- Understand **basic and advanced data structures** in Python.
- Implement **Stacks and Queues** using Python lists and `collections.deque`.
- Apply **good naming conventions** for clean, maintainable code.
- Work with **multi-dimensional arrays** using lists and the `array` module.
- Practice coding through **structured activities**.

## 1️⃣ Arrays
### **Theory**
An array is a collection of elements stored under one variable name. In Python, arrays are usually implemented using **lists**, which are dynamic and can store mixed data types.

**Key Points:**
- Arrays allow efficient storage and manipulation of data.
- Common operations: `append()`, `remove()`, indexing, iteration.

### **Python Example**
```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
numbers.append(60)
numbers.remove(30)
print(numbers)

## Why Important?
Arrays are the foundation for more advanced structures like stacks, queues, and matrices.
Activities

-Create an array of student names.
-Add and remove elements.
-Print elements in reverse order.
